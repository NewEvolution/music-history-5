#Music History 5

Dead-end split off of Music History.  Working with using flex-flow and a bunch of really hacky CSS to change the functionality of the Music History app.

All useful code was rolled back into the main Music History repo once flex-flow got ditched in favor of Bootstrap for the styling & responsiveness.
